# CLI: /usage command

## Context
Implement a discoverable `codex usage` (`/usage` alias) to print current 5h and weekly guardrail usage with reset times. Gracefully handle unavailable data.

## Plan
- Add `usage` subcommand in `codex-rs/cli` (alias `/usage`).
- Create a simple usage reporter with pluggable providers; default to a clear fallback message.
- Update help, add a basic CLI test.
- Validate with `cargo test -p codex-cli`.

## Notes
- Avoid touching sandbox env var logic.
- Keep TUI unchanged to avoid snapshot breaks; future PR can add a compact indicator.

## Results
- Implemented `usage` subcommand (alias `/usage`) with graceful fallback.
- Added test and README updates.
- Validated with `cargo test -p codex-cli`.

## Next
- Plug in real usage providers when upstream endpoints are available or when rate-limit headers are persisted by the client layer.
